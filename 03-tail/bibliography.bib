	abstract = {Summary


Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation plays a crucial role in the energy transition. Small-scale, residential PV installations are deployed at an unprecedented pace, and their safe integration into the grid necessitates up-to-date, high-quality information. Overhead imagery is increasingly used to improve the knowledge of residential PV installations with machine learning models capable of automatically mapping these installations. However, these models cannot be reliably transferred from one region or imagery source to another without incurring a decrease in accuracy. To address this issue, known as distribution shift, and foster the development of PV array mapping pipelines, we propose a dataset containing aerial images, segmentation masks, and installation metadata. We provide installation metadata for more than 28000 installations. We provide ground truth segmentation masks for 13000 installations, including 7000 with annotations for two different image providers. Finally, we provide installation metadata that matches the annotation for more than 8000 installations. Dataset applications include end-to-end PV registry construction, robust PV installations mapping, and analysis of crowdsourced datasets.


This dataset contains the complete records associated with the article "A crowdsourced dataset of aerial images of solar panels, their segmentation masks, and characteristics", published in Scientific data.

However, existing European datasets of RPV systems are often limited in both spatial coverage and precision, especially in regions with diverse architectural styles. This study presents a novel methodology for identifying RPV systems by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on high-resolution aerial imagery and building registry data. Alternatively to traditional tile-based methods, we propose a building-by-building approach, ensuring that each building is individually assessed. The model was trained and validated on five French departments representing a variety of roofing materials and urban typologies. It demonstrates a high correlation between predicted and registered RPV systems, though detection performance varies with roofing materials—achieving better accuracy on tiled roofs than slate roofs. When applied to the entire metropolitan French territory, the model processed images of more than 40 million buildings, identifying approximately 600,000 RPV systems. The results’ accuracy is evaluated, taking into account factors such as data quality and local urban characteristics. All data and the model are publicly available for further research and applications.},

Therefore, we present the Roof Information Dataset for semantic segmentation of roof segments and roof superstructures. We assessed the label quality of initial roof superstructure annotations by conducting an annotation experiment and identified annotator agreements of 0.15–0.70 mean intersection over union, depending on the class. We discuss associated the implications on the training and evaluation of two convolutional neural networks and found that the quality of the prediction behaved similarly to the annotator agreement for most classes. The class photovoltaic module was predicted to be best with a class-specific mean intersection over union of 0.69. By providing the datasets in initial and reviewed versions, we promote a data-centric approach for the semantic segmentation of roof information. Finally, we conducted a photovoltaic potential analysis case study and demonstrated the high impact of roof superstructures as well as the viability of the computer vision approach to increase accuracy. While this paper’s primary use case was roof information extraction for photovoltaic potential analysis, its implications can be transferred to other computer vision applications in remote sensing and beyond.},

	abstract = {Solar energy is an environmentally friendly energy source. Identifying suitable rooftops for solar panel installation contributes to not only sustainable energy plans but also carbon neutrality goals. Aerial imagery, bolstered by its growing availability, is a cost-effective data source for rooftop solar potential assessment at large scale. Existing studies generally do not take roof superstructures into account when determining how many solar panels can be installed. This procedure will lead to an overestimation of solar potential. Only several works have considered this issue, but none have devised a network that can simultaneously learn roof orientations and roof superstructures. Therefore, we devise SolarNet+, a novel framework to improve the precision of rooftop solar potential estimation. After implementing SolarNet+ on a benchmark dataset, we find that SolarNet+ outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks — roof orientations and roof superstructure segmentation. Moreover, the SolarNet+ framework enables rooftop solar estimation at large-scale applications for investigating the correlation between urban rooftop solar potential and various local climate zone (LCZ) types. The results in the city of Brussels reveal that three specific LCZ urban types exhibit the highest rooftop solar potential efficiency: compact highrise (LCZ1), compact midrise (LCZ2), and heavy industry (LCZ10). The annual photovoltaic potential for these LCZ types is reported as 10.56 GWh/year/km2, 11.77 GWh/year/km2, and 10.70 GWh/year/km2, respectively.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing has become the most important data source for the digital elevation model (DEM) generation. DEM analyses can be applied in various fields and many of them require appropriate DEM visualization support. Analytical hill-shading is the most frequently used relief visualization technique. Although widely accepted, this method has two major drawbacks: identifying details in deep shades and inability to properly represent linear features lying parallel to the light beam. Several authors have tried to overcome these limitations by changing the position of the light source or by filtering. This paper proposes a new relief visualization technique based on diffuse, rather than direct, illumination. It utilizes the sky-view factor—a parameter corresponding to the portion of visible sky limited by relief. Sky-view factor can be used as a general relief visualization technique to show relief characteristics. In particular, we show that this visualization is a very useful tool in archaeology as it improves the recognition of small scale features from high resolution DEMs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper presents the core methodology for assessing solar radiation and energy production on building rooftops and vertical facades (still rarely considered) of the inner-city. This integrated tool is based on the use of LiDAR, 2D and 3D cadastral data. Together with solar radiation and astronomical models, it calculates the global irradiance for a set of points located on roofs, ground, and facades. Although the tool takes simultaneously roofs, ground, and facades, different methods of shadow casting are applied. Shadow casting on rooftops is based on image processing techniques. On the other hand, the assessment on facade involves first to create and interpolate points along the facades and then to implement a point-by-point shadow casting routine. The paper is structured in five parts: (i) state of the art on the use of 3D GIS and automated processes in assessing solar radiation in the built environment, (ii) overview on the methodological framework used in the paper, (iii) detailed presentation of the method proposed for solar modeling and shadow casting, in particular by introducing an innovative approach for modeling the sky view factor (SVF), (iv) demonstration of the solar model introduced in this paper through applications in Geneva’s building roofs (solar cadaster) and facades, (v) validation of the solar model in some Geneva’s spots, focusing especially on two distinct comparisons: solar model versus fisheye catchments on partially inclined surfaces (roof component); solar model versus photovoltaic simulation tool PVSyst on vertical surfaces (facades). Concerning the roof component, validation results emphasize global sensitivity related to the density of light sources on the sky vault to model the SVF. The low dense sky model with 145 light sources gives satisfying results, especially when processing solar cadasters in large urban areas, thus allowing to save computation time. In the case of building facades, introducing weighting factor in SVF calculation leads to outputs close to those obtained by PVSyst. Such good validation results make the proposed model a reliable tool to: (i) automatically process solar cadaster on building rooftops and facades at large urban scales and (ii) support solar energy planning and energy transition policies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In the context of a rapid and massive deployment or renewable energy and in particular solar photovoltaic, it is necessary to develop methods and tools to guide this deployment. To this end, this work proposes a multicriteria approach for evaluating the suitability of a building to be equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems (PV suitability). In the present case, technical (roof complexity), economic (payback period), environmental (CO2 reduction), energetic (self-consumption), as well as social (heritage constraint) criteria are considered. These criteria are evaluated for each building of the Greater Geneva Agglomeration (GGA), a cross-border French–Swiss territory of nearly 270 000 buildings. A multicriteria method, ELECTRE TRI, makes it possible to sort these buildings into three categories, A, B, and C, that correspond to “very high,” “high,” and “moderate” PV suitabilities, respectively. Large differences are observed within the 210 municipalities of the GGA since some of them have almost no A-ranked buildings whereas others comprise more than 70\% of these buildings. It is shown that, by prioritizing the A-ranked buildings, almost 50\% of the annual electricity consumption of the Geneva Canton could be produced by PV systems. Finally, the method developed here offers a decision-aiding tool that could be used at a territory scale to achieve energy transition goals in terms of solar PV deployment.},

The main aim of the study was to update the current state of the research based on the analysis of previous works. An attempt was made to assess the role of GIS in research on the solar potential of cities in the context of the overall investigation process. A total of 201 case studies published between 1999 and 2024 (year to date) were analysed, among which articles from 2019–24 were examined in detail. The analysis revealed a wide variation in the approaches regarding the spatial scale of studies and the sources of key data, such as shading and solar radiation. It was shown that one of the key challenges in current analyses is the lack of universality of the methodologies used, leading to divergent, and sometimes challenging to compare final results. In the research aspect, a global urban solar potential was estimated for cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, which amounted to 33.7 PW h annually.},

Such sorting can provide relevant information to help and guide urban actors further develop solar energy, and therefore contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of this source of energy in cities. Three scenarios of sorting are considered: the energetic, the economic and the multicriteria sorting. The energetic and economic sorting scenarios are actually similar to the great majority of the currently proposed sorting in publicly available solar GIS tools (solar cadastre), which consider only one attribute such as the solar irradiation or the payback period. Knowing the limits of these sorting scenarios, a multicriteria approach is adopted and takes into account more impactful attributes in the urban actors’ choices. The ELECTRE TRI methodology is used for this sorting problem. Different decisional criteria related to energy, economy, historic buildings and heritage, the structure and superstructure states of the roof are identified and detailed. The method is then applied to a set of alternatives (roofs) in a district of Geneva. The sorting results show that the proposed multicriteria scenario better integrates the complexity of the urban environment and provides a more relevant information regarding the suitability of the roofs for PV integration.},

The SVM correctly identifies six types of roof shapes in 66\% of cases, that is, flat \& shed, gable, hip, gambrel \& mansard, cross/corner gable \& hip, and complex roofs. We classify the roofs based on their useful area for PV installations and potential for receiving solar energy.

The main exception is the gable where this ratio is 1.18. The flat and shed roofs have the second highest useful roof area for PV (complex roof being the highest) and the highest PV potential (in GWh). By contrast, hip roof has the lowest PV potential.

            Mapping the location and size of solar installations in urban areas can be a valuable input for policymakers and for investing in distributed energy infrastructures. Machine Learning techniques, combined with satellite and aerial imagery, allow to overcome the limitations of surveys and sparse databases in providing this mapping at large scale. In this paper we apply a supervised method based on convolutional neural networks to delineate rooftop solar panels and to detect their sizes by means of pixel-wise image segmentation. As input to the algorithm, we rely on high resolution aerial photos provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography. We explore different data augmentation and we vary network parameters in order to maximize model performance. Preliminary results show that we are able to automatically detect in test images the area of a set of solar panels at pixel level with an accuracy of about 0.94 and an Intersection over Union index of up to 0.64. The scalability of the trained model allows to predict the existing solar panels deployment at the Swiss national scale. The correlation with local environmental and socio-economic variables would allow to extract predictive models to foster future adoption of solar technology in urban areas.},

This study is focused on the development of an automated method to extract the useable areas of rooftops and optimize the solar PV panel layout based on the given electricity loading of a building. In this context, the authors of this article developed two crucial methods. First, a special pixel-based rooftop recognition methodology was developed to analyze detailed and complex rooftop types while avoiding the challenges associated with the nature of the particular building rooftops. Second, a multi-objective enveloped min–max optimization algorithm was developed to maximize solar energy generation and minimize energy cost in terms of payback based on the marginal price signals. This optimization algorithm facilitates the optimal integration of three controlled variables—tilt angle, azimuth angle, and inter-row spacing—under a non-linear optimization space. The performance of proposed algorithms is demonstrated using three campus buildings at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada as case studies. It is shown that the proposed algorithms can be used to optimize PV panel distribution while effectively maintaining system constraints.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel strategy for roof segmentation from aerial images (orthophotoplans) based on the cooperation of edge- and region-based segmentation methods. The proposed strategy is composed of three major steps. The first one, called the pre-processing step, consists of simplifying the acquired image with an appropriate couple of invariant and gradient, optimized for the application, in order to limit illumination changes (shadows, brightness, etc.) affecting the images. The second step is composed of two main parallel treatments: on the one hand, the simplified image is segmented by watershed regions. Even if the first segmentation of this step provides good results in general, the image is often over-segmented. To alleviate this problem, an efficient region merging strategy adapted to the orthophotoplan particularities, with a 2D modeling of roof ridges technique, is applied. On the other hand, the simplified image is segmented by watershed lines. The third step consists of integrating both watershed segmentation strategies into a single cooperative segmentation scheme in order to achieve satisfactory segmentation results. Tests have been performed on orthophotoplans containing 100 roofs with varying complexity, and the results are evaluated with the VINETcriterion using ground-truth image segmentation. A comparison with five popular segmentation techniques of the literature demonstrates the effectiveness and the reliability of the proposed approach. Indeed, we obtain a good segmentation rate of 96\% with the proposed method compared to 87.5\% with statistical region merging (SRM), 84\% with mean shift, 82\% with color structure code (CSC), 80\% with efficient graph-based segmentation algorithm (EGBIS) and 71\% with JSEG.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in many domains require more and more complicated experiment design. Such complicated experiments often have many parameters, which necessitate parameter tuning. Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), a Bayesian optimization method, is widely used in recent parameter tuning frameworks. Despite its popularity, the roles of each control parameter and the algorithm intuition have not been discussed so far. In this tutorial, we will identify the roles of each control parameter and their impacts on hyperparameter optimization using a diverse set of benchmarks. We compare our recommended setting drawn from the ablation study with baseline methods and demonstrate that our recommended setting improves the performance of TPE. Our TPE implementation is available at https://github.com/nabenabe0928/tpe/tree/single-opt.},

	abstract = {Due to imaging and lighting directions, shadows are inevitably formed in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. This causes shadowed regions with missed and occluded information, such as color and texture details. Shadow detection and compensation from remote sensing images is essential for recovering the missed information contained in these images. Current methods are mainly aimed at processing shadows with simple scenes. For UAV remote sensing images with a complex background and multiple shadows, problems inevitably occur, such as color distortion or texture information loss in the shadow compensation result. In this paper, we propose a novel shadow removal algorithm from UAV remote sensing images based on color and texture equalization compensation of local homogeneous regions. Firstly, the UAV imagery is split into blocks by selecting the size of the sliding window. The shadow was enhanced by a new shadow detection index (SDI) and threshold segmentation was applied to obtain the shadow mask. Then, the homogeneous regions are extracted with LiDAR intensity and elevation information. Finally, the information of the non-shadow objects of the homogeneous regions is used to restore the missed information in the shadow objects of the regions. The results revealed that the average overall accuracy of shadow detection is 98.23\% and the average F1 score is 95.84\%. The average color difference is 1.891, the average shadow standard deviation index is 15.419, and the average gradient similarity is 0.726. The results have shown that the proposed method performs well in both subjective and objective evaluations.},

            Solar photovoltaic (PV) is an increasingly significant fraction of electricity generation. Efficient management, and innovations such as short-term forecasting and machine vision, demand high-resolution geographic datasets of PV installations. However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86\% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66 GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93 GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.},

	abstract = {Solar power is a clean and renewable energy source. Promoting solar technology can not only offer all people affordable, reliable, and modern energy, but also mitigate energy-related emissions and pollutants. This significantly contributes to sustainable development goals. Aerial imagery can provide a cost-effective way for large-scale rooftop solar potential analysis when compared to other data sources. Existing studies mainly utilize aerial imagery and convolutional neural networks to learn the roof segmentation mask or the rooftop geometry map, which are the preliminary input for rooftop solar potential estimation. However, these methods fail to achieve precise solar potential analysis results. To address this issue, we propose a framework, which is termed as SolarNet for rooftop solar potential estimation. A novel multi-task learning network is devised in SolarNet to learn our proposed novel representation for rooftop geometry that incorporates 6 roof segments and orientations. Specifically, this network first learns a roof segmentation map, and then together with the extracted multiscale and contextual features to learn a roof geometry map. Finally, the solar potential can be estimated from the learned roof geometry map. The effectiveness of SolarNet is validated on two datasets: DeepRoof and RID datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SolarNet can improve not only rooftop geometry prediction accuracy but also solar potential estimation precision, which significantly outperforms other competitors.},

certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes.
